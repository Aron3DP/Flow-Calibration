Print the first plate with your filament profile set to an EM of 1.0 and do so for all following tests.

Find which top layers look good and if needed print another range between two you pick to fine tune. This method has yet to fail me. I am not a fan of the OrcaSlicer Flow Generator as I have found it to be off around 3% or so.
